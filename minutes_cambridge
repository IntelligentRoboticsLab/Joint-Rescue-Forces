### Wednesday March 20 ###

11:00 Rapid Manufacturing Challenge is interesting of undergraduate level. Yet, it is very much focused on locomotion, while sensing and cooperation are more interesting for Rescue Simulation. 
Creating realistic interactions with the environment with physical engines is hard. Something which could be interesting is manipulation. At the WRS victims are caried out of the disaster, maybe we could introduce such a task in the Virtual Competition. 
It is already a task in CoSpace (double points if you deliver your collected victims to base). 

14:00 Developing a new platform for Junior level should consider requirements for Primary (below 14) and Open (14 till 1th year applied undergraduate).
For Primary Scratch is a good option, but Ubuntu/ROS/Gazebo overkill. Maybe Scratch/[Webots}(https://cyberbotics.com/). 
For Open a Python or Matlab interface could be an option.

15:00 The Scratch ROS demonstration on the Turtle bot works, but catching all keyboard-events for teleoperating is quite a lot of modules. We should look if it is possible to hide all ROS-interface blocks in a nested myblock.

16:00 For the moment: 
* Josie will explore Scratch - Webots combination
* Arnoud will explore the Octave - ROS combination
* Masuru will explore Scratch-ROS-Gazebo and try to represent CoSpace World. Maybe wise to select a small robot, such as the Kephara or Turtlerobot.

### Thursday March 21 ###

9:00 Update of last night progress
* Josie has explored open source alternatives for Scratch with better Python interface and more flexible MyBlock nesting: Blocky from Google
* Josie also found some projects that were able to connect Scratch-like programs to robots, but they are less general
* Josie has explored Webots and V-REP. V-REP is more advanced, but very C-oriented. Webots has more interface possibilities

* Masuru has made small direct-drive robot with three sensors at the front for Gazebo.
* Arnoud has experimented with ROS for Windows, which worked fine, except for the Scratch-GUI.
* Arnoud has installed the tutorial example of Matlab-ROS, and will see if he can replicate that in Octave.

14:00 morning progress

* Arnoud created a beginning of a installation manual at https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLab/Joint-Rescue-Forces/wiki/Installation-Instructions-Junior-Simulation
* Arnoud has experimented with driving the Turtlebot from Matlab, via ROS for Windows. That works.
* Arnoud created an Octave package from the ROS toolbox, which still has some dependencies

* Josie was able to create an autonomous robot in Webots (ePuck) by Matlab, Python and C.
* Josie is now trying to make custom blocks in Blocky, but that requires JavaScript.

* Masuru has finished the direct-drive robot and is now creating a simple World

16:00 afternoon progress

* Arnoud found out that porting the Matlab ROS toolbox to an Octave package is hard, because the toolbox is nicely implemented with namespaces, which are not available in Octave.

* Josie can make custom blocks in Blocky, export that in Python-code and import this code in Webots.
* Josie found out that robotics blocks in Snap, and send the corresponding Python-code via a socket to V-REP.
* Josie is now looking if she could build a socket-interface for Webots.

* Masuru finished a first version of the world (with three obstacles, but no traps). He could drive the robot around with the keyboard, the collisions seems realistic.

18:00 evening process

* Reyhaneh has discussed CoSpace with the Iranian CoSpace teams. Both the students and teachers really like the current 'make your dll approach'.
* Scratch is used in Iran quite often, but only in the first grades of primary school.
* They propose two ways to integrate CoSpace and Gazebo, one is via an plugin that reads the CoSpace-calls and sends them to a Gazebo socket.
* They propose to use Gazebo on Windows, as described at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_on_windows
* To have Gazebo running natively under Windows sounds great, but the install procedure is complex and requires 30 Gb (more than most high-school students will have free).

* Arnoud will install Gazebo on Windows.
