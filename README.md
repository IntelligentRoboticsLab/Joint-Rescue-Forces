# Joint-Rescue-Forces
This repository contains the public code, created by the Joint Rescue Forces, for a number of workshop, in each of the branches.

The workshop in 2019 (in the CoSpace branch) is to show how a bridge could made between the Junior Rescue Simulation and Virtual Robot competition. The workshop has a [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLab/Joint-Rescue-Forces/wiki/RoboCup-2019).

The workshop in 2018 (in the machine_learning branch) is to show how state-of-the-art algorithms available in MATLAB could be directly applied in the RoboCup Rescue Simulation League. Also this workshop has a [dedicated wiki page](https://github.com/IntelligentRoboticsLab/Joint-Rescue-Forces/wiki/RoboCup-2018).

For more details, see Arnoud Visser, Luis Gustavo Nardin and Sebastian Castro, “RoboCup Rescue Simulation Machine Learning Workshop“, University of Amsterdam, Brandenburg University of Technology & MathWorks, 10 February 2018.
