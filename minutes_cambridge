11:00 Rapid Manufacturing Challenge is interesting of undergraduate level. Yet, it is very much focused on locomotion, while sensing and cooperation are more interesting for Rescue Simulation. Creating realistic interactions with the environment with physical engines is hard. Something which could be interesting is manipulation. At the WRS victims are caried out of the disaster, maybe we could introduce such a task in the Virtual Competition. It is already a task in CoSpace (double points if you deliver your collected victims to base).
